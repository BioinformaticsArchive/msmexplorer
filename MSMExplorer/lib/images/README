The images in this folder are intended as an example of correct image file format and as a demonstration of MSMExplorer's support for auxilliary images. 

As there are 5 images, these are intended to be used for the MSM 5macro.xml, which is opened by default. These images do not represent a consistent set of data and should be considered as demonstration images only.
