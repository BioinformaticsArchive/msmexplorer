A relatively complete changelog. Also check the commit messages on the svn directory.

August 2010:
Initial Revision

April 2011:
Added graph statistics (density, # edges, # nodes, avg degree) via GraphStatsManager class.
Added slider/text box to filter visibility by equilibrium probability/
Heuristic to deal with layout performance problems on graphs with relative few nodes by very high connectivity.
4/5/2011 - Created GraphStatsManager class (why? whatever.). Calculates Avg degree. Used as bandaid to help TJ's MSM display a little more easily.
4/27/2011 -  Added GraphStatsWindow class, which is basically just a panel that holds GraphStatsManager-generate statics. Implemented eigenvectorCentrality, SelfRefEdgeRenderer work
4/28/2011 - Adjusted SelfRefEdgeRenderer to make edges circles with radius proportional to average node bounds. Adjustments on default force simulation parameters. Frustrations with slider stacking.
May 2011:
5/4/2011 - Hacked a method to allow eqProb and graph distance filters to play together. Should be addressed properly, probably with rangequeryfilters and AND predicates.
5/18/2011-- fixed up axis layout for TPTWindow display
5/31/2011 -- the DAT and MTX importers seem to be working. There's an abstract MSMReader class that can be extended to import other formats. The abstract class provides a few constants, an edge and node table, and equilibrium probability operations.
June:
6/13/2011 -- added graphml save functionality. A few little fixes.
